# Data Analytics & Science
> Training material and references for Data Analytics and Data Science with Python

## Contents
This repository contains 4 days worth of training materials.
Each day contains data sets, exercises, slides, and references to books worth reading.

Besides focusing on Data Science skills, this course also includes hard skills useful in programming like Git, writing clean code, and unit testing.

Topics covered in the entire course include:
- Working with Git
- Writing clean code in Python
- When and how to unit test in Python
- Machine learning with Python
- Data wrangling with Python
- Statistical methods in Python
	- Supervised and unsupervised learning
	- Linear Regression
	- Classification

In the last 1.5 days of the course, the trainees are challenged to form teams and select a kaggle dataset to do some science.
This part is included because Data Science often isn't a beaten path. You have to figure out what to do with a dataset and suggest meaningful insights.

## Prequisite knowledge
To be able to have smooth start with the contents found in this repository, the following skills are recommended:
- Experience in programming with Python
- Experience in working with python libraries meant for data science like pandas, numpy etc..
- Some knowledge about basic statistics
- A mind willing to learn
