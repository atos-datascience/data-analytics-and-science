# Data Analytics & Science
> Training material and references for Data Analytics and Data Science with Python

## Contents
This repository contains 4 days worth of training materials.
Each day contains data sets, exercises, slides, and references to books worth reading.

Besides focusing on Data Science skills, this course also includes hard skills useful in programming like Git, writing clean code, and unit testing.

Topics covered in the entire course include:
- Working with Git
- Writing clean code in Python
- When and how to unit test in Python
- Machine learning with Python
- Data wrangling with Python
- Statistical methods in Python
	- Supervised and unsupervised learning
	- Linear Regression
	- Classification

In the last 1.5 days of the course, the trainees are challenged to form teams and select a kaggle dataset to do some science.
This part is included because Data Science often isn't a beaten path. You have to figure out what to do with a dataset and suggest meaningful insights.

## Prequisite knowledge
To be able to have smooth start with the contents found in this repository, the following skills are recommended:
- Experience in programming with Python
- Experience in working with python libraries meant for data science like pandas, numpy etc..
- Some knowledge about basic statistics
- A mind willing to learn

## Basic workflow for machine learning problems
1) State the question and determine required data
2) Acquire the data in an accessible format
3) Identify and correct missing data points/anomalies as required
4) Prepare the data for the machine learning model
5) Establish a baseline model that you aim to exceed
6) Train the model on the training data
7) Make predictions on the test data
8) Compare predictions to the known test set targets and calculate performance metrics
9) If performance is not satisfactory, adjust the model, acquire more data, or try a different modeling technique
10) Interpret model and report results visually and numerically
